    "## 1-Group Critical Equation\n",
    "The analytic solution is arrived at by using the 1-Group Critical Equation given by:\n",
    "$$B_1^2 = \\frac{k_{\\infty}-1}{L^2}$$\n",
    "where $B_1^2$ is the buckling, and $L^2$ is the diffusion area; and $k_{\\infty}$ is the infinite multiplication factor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The buckling depends on geometry; for this problem, the domain is spherical and buckling is given by:\n",
    "$$B^{2}=\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{\\tilde{R}}\\right)^{2}$$\n",
    "where $\\tilde{R}$ is the extrapolated radius of the sphere: $\\tilde{R}=R+d$; with $d$ being the extrapolation distance.  The extrapolation distance is base on the diffusion coefficient: $d = 2.13D$ and the diffusion coefficient $(D)$ is based on the macroscopic transport cross section: $D=\\frac{1}{3\\Sigma_{tr}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The macroscopic transport cross section is, in turn, computed from the corresponding microscopic cross section $(\\sigma_{tr})$ and the atom density of the Pu-239 material.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We're almost to the bottom of the rabbit hole...\n",
    "\n",
    "The diffusion area is based on the diffusion coefficient and the macroscopic absorption cross section:\n",
    "$$L^{2}=\\frac{D}{\\Sigma_{a}}$$\n",
    "and, similar to the macroscopic transport cross section, $\\Sigma_{a}$ is computed with the atom density of the Pu-239 material and the corresponding microscopic cross section $(\\sigma_a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, $k_{\\infty}$ is the infinite multiplication factor.  It is based on the regeneration factor ($\\eta$) which we will take to be a known material property of Pu-239 and the fuel utilization, $f$, which we will take to be unity since the domain where neutrons will be diffusing and interacting is 100% fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this long discussion is implemented in the code below.  Note that all elements of the equations above can be taken to be known *except* for the radius $R$.\n"
